\subsection{ActivityNet Captions}

\par It contains 100k dense natural language descriptions of approximately 20k videos from ActivityNet, totaling 849 hours. Each description contains 13.48 words on average and covers approximately 36 seconds of video. Every video has multiple descriptions, and when combined, these descriptions cover 94.6 percent of the content in the video. Furthermore, the dataset's 10 percent temporal overlap makes it particularly interesting and challenging for studying multiple events that occur at the same time. The dataset consists of 200 action classes with distribution among training, validation and testing as ~50\%, ~25\%, ~25\% respectively.   \cite{krishna2017densecaptioning}
\par Since our method also uses audio as input, there is a need to download all YouTube videos for audio extraction. However few videos from the dataset were removed by their creators. The current distribution among training, validation and testing is ~9351, 4626 and 4464 videos respectively.
